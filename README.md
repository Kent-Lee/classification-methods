# Classification Methods on Titanic Dataset

Assignment report: [Titanic Dataset Analysis](https://kent-lee.github.io/classification-methods/)

This is the third programming assignment for CMPT 459 Data Mining course; it continues the previous assignment with a focus on classification methods. The assignment consists of two main parts:

1. **classifications**: apply `random forest`, `logistic regression`, `SVM` models on the training data to predict class labels of the testing data

2. **performance measurement**: use `AUC` and `ROC` to measure the performance of the classifications, then tune the `SVM` models to find the optimal parameter configurations
